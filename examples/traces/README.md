# Tracing

This kustomize manifest exemplifies how to configure a custom processor and add
it to the pipeline responsible for traces. The configuration example is taken
from the [tail sampling processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/tailsamplingprocessor)
docs.
